                    options. </Typography>
                <Typography my={1}><strong>Flats for rent in Dubai</strong> come in various sizes, including economical,
                    luxury, furnished,
                    unfurnished, and serviced apartments. Visitors seeking apartments in Dubai can also select from

                    which have two or three levels and are similar to townhouses but offer the amenities and convenience
                    of apartments. There are also flats, often known as serviced apartments in Dubai, where all bills
                    are normally included in the rental amount, and the visitor will incur no further costs. Because of
                    this, the rental fee for serviced flats in Dubai is often higher. Most Dubai-serviced flats also

                <Typography>The cost of renting a vacation apartment for short-term rental in Dubai can vary depending
                    on several factors, such as location, size, amenities, and time of year. Generally, the rent per
                    night for a vacation apartment in Dubai is comparatively high. Booking vacation homes for short-term
                    rentals is expensive but does not require any long-term commitment.</Typography>

                    Dubai, you
                    can expect to pay around AED 500 to AED 800 per night. The cost may range from AED 800 to AED 1,200

                <Typography my={2}>It&apos;s important to note that prices can also vary depending on the length of stay
                    and
                    the time of year. Short-term rentals during peak tourist seasons like winter and early spring are
                    more expensive than during off-peak seasons.</Typography>
                <Typography my={2}>It&apos;s always recommended to research and compare prices from different vacation
                    rental
